“cleaned animations' and “dsh-archea-animation-signe” are animations used
in “the one timeline” in “akt1”. The “dsh-fangest” is used for the time 
“timelinebakterie” and “timelinealge” in “akt1”. 

Someone accidently used some of the the non cleaned versions of the 
animations for “the one timeline” so we are using parts of 
“cleaned animations” and “dsh-archea-animation-signe” at the same time 
while we should only be using “cleaned animations”
