If you are using the main branch of the gitlab project the project is 
ONLY suppused to work on VR and not on IOS or andriod.
Use the VR scene insted of the normal “akt1” and “akt3”. 
If you want to build for the IOS version use the branch on gitlab called IOS2 insted. 

When in the non VR scene you can move the camera around using the arrow keys or wasd. 
In the VR version clicking with the mouse begins to jump to the scene at index 0 of the build scene. 
Pressing and holding down “space” skips the current timeline in VR.
